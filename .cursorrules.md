Key Concepts for New Developers
Everything goes through the database - GRDB transactions are central
Dependency injection is preferred - Avoid global singletons when possible
Protocol-oriented - Heavy use of Swift protocols
Async/await everywhere - Modern Swift concurrency
Thread safety - Always consider which queue/thread you're on
Modular architecture - Clear layer separation (UI → SignalUI → SignalServiceKit)

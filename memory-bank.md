# Alice's Memory Bank

I am Alice, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

**Core Requirements (10 Hard Requirements):**
1. One-on-one Chat Functionality
2. Real-time Message Delivery (2+ users)
3. Message Persistence (Survives App Restarts)
4. Optimistic UI Updates
5. Online/Offline Status Indicators
6. Message Timestamps
7. User Authentication (Accounts/Profiles)
8. Basic Group Chat Functionality (3+ users)
9. Message Read Receipts
10. Push Notifications (Foreground)

**Success Criteria (Must Have - P0 MVP):**
- ✅ Users can successfully create an account and log in
- ✅ Users can start and participate in 1-on-1 conversations
- ✅ Users can start and participate in group (3+ user) conversations

## 3. Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**
- ✅ **MVP COMPLETE** - All 10 P0 requirements + 3 P1 features done
- ✅ **Pre-Phase Complete** - Typing indicators implemented, docs updated
- 🔄 **Phase 1 Started** - Performance optimization infrastructure ready
- 🎯 **Goal** - Achieve 80+ points on Post-MVP rubric

**Recent Changes (Oct 22, 2025):**
- ✅ Implemented typing indicators (TypingService.swift, TypingIndicatorView.swift)
  - Real-time with Firebase Realtime DB
  - < 200ms appearance, auto-clear after 3s
  - Multi-user support: "Alice & Bob are typing..."
- ✅ Created PerformanceMonitor.swift for tracking latency
  - Message send → ack → render tracking
  - App launch, navigation, sync timing
  - Statistics: p50, p95, p99 calculations
- ✅ Updated database.rules.json for typing path (needs deployment)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

**Next Steps:**
1. **Deploy Firebase rules**: `firebase deploy --only database`
2. **Phase 1.1** - Measure performance baselines
   - Test message latency (target p95 < 200ms)
   - Test burst messaging (20+ messages)
   - Verify presence propagation < 500ms
3. **Phase 1.2-1.5** - Optimize and collect evidence
4. **Phases 2-5** - Technical polish, AI features, innovation bonus

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- Using PerformanceMonitor for real-time metrics tracking
- Firebase Realtime DB for typing (faster than Firestore)
- Post-MVP focus: optimize core first, AI features last
- Target: Remote Team Professional persona (minimal, detox from overload)

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**
- Performance-first approach: measure before optimizing
- Evidence-driven: capture metrics, videos, screenshots
- Phase-by-phase execution: complete one before starting next
- Documentation in memory-bank.md (single source of truth)

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
- MVP foundation is solid - all 13 features working
- Performance monitoring enables data-driven optimization
- Typing indicators need Firebase Realtime DB for sub-200ms speed
- Documentation consolidation reduces complexity

## 4. System Patterns

**System Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Native iOS app built with SwiftUI
- **Backend:** Firebase Backend-as-a-Service
- **Database:** Firestore (NoSQL) for main data, Realtime Database for presence
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging + Apple Push Notification service
- **Server Logic:** Cloud Functions for push notification triggers

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **SwiftUI over UIKit:** Faster development, better data binding, cross-platform potential
- **Firebase over custom backend:** Comprehensive feature coverage, real-time capabilities, offline support
- **Firestore over SQL:** NoSQL structure fits chat data model, real-time listeners, offline cache
- **Optimistic UI:** Immediate user feedback, then server confirmation

**Design Patterns in Use:**
- **MVVM Architecture:** SwiftUI views with ViewModels for state management
- **Repository Pattern:** Data access layer for Firebase operations
- **Observer Pattern:** Firestore snapshot listeners for real-time updates
- **Offline-First:** Local persistence with sync when online

**Component Relationships:**
- **Authentication Service:** Handles user sign-up, login, session management
- **Chat Service:** Manages chat creation, message sending, real-time updates
- **Presence Service:** Tracks online/offline status using Realtime Database
- **Notification Service:** Handles push notification registration and delivery

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
1. **User Flow:** Onboarding → Home → Chat → Real-time messaging
2. **Message Flow:** User input → Optimistic UI → Firestore write → Real-time sync
3. **Offline Flow:** Local cache → Queue messages → Sync when online
4. **Notification Flow:** New message → Cloud Function → FCM → Push notification

- [ ] Implement [service method name]
  - Test Gate: Unit test passes
- [ ] Add validation logic
  - Test Gate: Edge cases handled correctly

---

## 3. Data Model & Rules

- [ ] Define new types/structs in Swift
- [ ] Update Firestore schema (if needed)
- [ ] Add Firebase security rules

  - Test Gate: Data syncs across devices <100ms
- [ ] Offline persistence
  - Test Gate: App restarts work offline with cached data
- [ ] Presence/status indicators (if applicable)
  - Test Gate: Online/offline states reflect correctly

---

## 6. Tests

Follow patterns from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` and `MessageAI/agents/test-template.md`.

- [ ] Unit Tests (XCTest)
  - Path: `PsstTests/{Feature}Tests.swift`
  - Test Gate: Service logic validated, edge cases covered
  
- [ ] UI Tests (XCUITest)
  - Path: `PsstUITests/{Feature}UITests.swift`
  - Test Gate: User flows succeed, navigation works
  
- [ ] Service Tests (if applicable)
  - Path: `PsstTests/Services/{ServiceName}Tests.swift`
  - Test Gate: Firebase operations tested
  
- [ ] Multi-device sync test
  - Test Gate: Use pattern from shared-standards.md
  
- [ ] Visual states verification
  - Test Gate: Empty, loading, error, success render correctly

---

## 7. Performance

Verify targets from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- [ ] App load time < 2-3 seconds
  - Test Gate: Cold start to interactive measured
- [ ] Message latency < 100ms
  - Test Gate: Firebase calls measured
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling (100+ items)
  - Test Gate: Use LazyVStack, verify with instruments

---

## 8. Acceptance Gates

Check every gate from PRD Section 12:
- [ ] All happy path gates pass
- [ ] All edge case gates pass
- [ ] All multi-user gates pass
- [ ] All performance gates pass

---

## 9. Documentation & PR

- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Create PR description (use format from MessageAI/agents/coder-agent-template.md)

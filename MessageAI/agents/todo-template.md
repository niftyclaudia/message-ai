---

## 6. Tests

Follow patterns from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` and `MessageAI/agents/test-template.md`.

- [ ] Unit Tests (XCTest)
  - Path: `PsstTests/{Feature}Tests.swift`

  - Path: `PsstUITests/{Feature}UITests.swift`
  - Test Gate: User flows succeed, navigation works
  
- [ ] Service Tests (if applicable)
  - Path: `PsstTests/Services/{ServiceName}Tests.swift`
  - Test Gate: Firebase operations tested
  
- [ ] Multi-device sync test
  - Test Gate: Use pattern from shared-standards.md
  
- [ ] Visual states verification
  - Test Gate: Empty, loading, error, success render correctly

---

## 7. Performance

Verify targets from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

  - Test Gate: Firebase calls measured
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling (100+ items)
  - Test Gate: Use LazyVStack, verify with instruments

## 8. Acceptance Gates

Check every gate from PRD Section 12:
- [ ] All happy path gates pass
- [ ] All edge case gates pass
- [ ] All multi-user gates pass
- [ ] All performance gates pass

---

## 9. Documentation & PR

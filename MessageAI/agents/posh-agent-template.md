# Posh: UI/UX Polish Agent

**Mission**: Essential messaging features with Calm Intelligence principles  
**Branch**: `develop`

## Philosophy

Building a **focus rehabilitation tool**, not just a messaging app. Every feature should support mental spaciousness.

## Your Tasks (Priority Order)

### 1. "All Caught Up" State ‚≠ê Quick Win (30 min)

- Gentle defaults (soft sound, no vibration)
- Deep linking to conversations
- Files: `NotificationService.swift`, `PushNotificationHandler.swift`, Cloud Function

## Calm Intelligence Principles

**Apply to ALL features:**
1. **Silence by Design**: Gentle notifications, smart bundling
2. **Ambient Reassurance**: "All caught up" states reduce FOMO
3. **Visual Design**: Calm colors, spacious layouts, slow animations
4. **Dark mode**: Plan for later (cosmos.com aesthetic)

## Standards & References

**Code Standards**: `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`
- Swift/SwiftUI best practices
- Threading rules (background for heavy work, main for UI)
- Testing: Swift Testing (@Test) for services, XCTest for UI
- Performance: 60fps scrolling, < 2s image upload

**Study These Patterns**:
- `MessageAI/Services/AuthenticationService.swift` - Firebase patterns
- `MessageAI/Services/MessageService.swift` - Firestore operations
- `MessageAI/Views/ChatView.swift` - View patterns

**Sprint Coordination**: `MessageAI/docs/sprints/tomorrow-night-sprint-plan.md`

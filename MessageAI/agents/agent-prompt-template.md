Branch pattern: feat/ai-XXX-feature-name

**OAuth & Secrets Management:**
When working with third-party APIs (Google Calendar, etc.):

1. **OAuth Setup (Google Cloud Console)**
   - Enable required API (e.g., Google Calendar API)
   - Create OAuth consent screen (External, add required scopes)
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application type, even for iOS)
   - Redirect URI: `https://{project-id}.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
   - Download Client ID + Client Secret

2. **Secrets Storage (ALWAYS use Firebase Secrets for production)**
   ```bash
   # For production (recommended - uses Secret Manager)
   firebase functions:secrets:set API_CLIENT_ID
   firebase functions:secrets:set API_CLIENT_SECRET
   
   # For local dev only (create functions/.env.local, already in .gitignore)
   API_CLIENT_ID=your-id
   API_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
   ```

3. **Using Secrets in Code**
   ```typescript
   import { defineSecret } from 'firebase-functions/params';
   
   const clientId = defineSecret('API_CLIENT_ID');
   const clientSecret = defineSecret('API_CLIENT_SECRET');
   
   export const myFunction = onCall(
     { secrets: [clientId, clientSecret] },
     async (request) => {
       const id = clientId.value();
       const secret = clientSecret.value();
       // Use for OAuth flow
     }
   );
   ```

4. **Security Rules**
   - ✅ Use Firebase Secrets (Secret Manager) for production
   - ✅ Use .env.local for local development only
   - ❌ NEVER commit secrets to git
   - ❌ NEVER put secrets in iOS/frontend code
   - ❌ NEVER use firebase functions:config:set (deprecated)

Start by reading your instruction file, then begin.

## Notes

- **YOLO mode**: Controls whether Planning Agent stops for feedback after PRD
  - `false` = Create PRD → Stop for review → Create TODO after approval
  - `true` = Create both PRD and TODO without stopping

- **Always reference**:
  - `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for common patterns
  - `MessageAI/agents/{agent-type}-template.md` for detailed instructions
  - Templates for structure

- **Branch strategy**: Always from `develop`, PR targets `develop`

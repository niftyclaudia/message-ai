- `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` — Common requirements and standards

## Output Documents

**Create these:**
- PRD: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`
- TODO: `MessageAI/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Understand

1. Find your PR in `MessageAI/docs/pr-brief/pr-briefs.md`
2. Read supporting docs (architecture, full features, existing PRDs)
3. Answer key questions:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is the user?
   - What's the end-to-end outcome?
   - What files will be modified/created?
   - What are the technical constraints?
   - What could go wrong (risks)?

### Step 2: Create PRD

**File:** `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`

Use the template at `MessageAI/agents/prd-template.md` and reference standards from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

**Critical sections:**
1. **Summary** — Problem and outcome in 1-2 sentences
2. **Problem & Goals** — User problem, why now, 2-3 measurable goals
3. **Non-Goals** — What's excluded to avoid scope creep
4. **Success Metrics** — Use template from shared-standards.md
5. **Users & Stories** — 3-5 user stories
6. **Experience Specification** — Entry points, flows, states, performance targets
7. **Functional Requirements** — MUST vs SHOULD with acceptance gates
8. **Data Model** — Reference examples from shared-standards.md
9. **Service Contracts** — Specify methods with parameters/returns/errors
10. **UI Components** — List all files to create/modify
11. **Test Plan** — Define BEFORE implementation with checkboxes
12. **Definition of Done** — Complete checklist
13. **Risks & Mitigations** — Identify 3-5 risks

**For every requirement, add an acceptance gate:**
```
[Gate] When User A sends message → User B sees it in <100ms
```

### Step 3: Check YOLO Mode

**🛑 If YOLO: false**
1. Present completed PRD to user
2. Wait for review and feedback
3. Make requested changes
4. Only proceed after explicit approval

**If YOLO: true**
- Continue directly to Step 4

### Step 4: Create TODO

**File:** `MessageAI/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

Use the template at `MessageAI/agents/todo-template.md`.

**Guidelines:**
- Each task < 30 min of work
- Tasks sequential (do A before B)
- Use checkboxes for tracking
- Group related tasks into sections
- Include acceptance criteria per task

**Typical sections:**
1. Setup (branch creation, read docs)
2. Data Model (schema, Firebase rules)
3. Service Layer (implement methods, validation)
4. UI Components (views, state management)
5. Integration (Firebase, real-time listeners)
6. Testing (unit, UI, multi-device)
7. Performance (verify targets from shared-standards.md)
8. Documentation (comments, README, PR description)

### Step 5: Review and Finalize

**Self-review checklist:**

PRD:
- [ ] All template sections filled
- [ ] Acceptance gates for every requirement
- [ ] Data model clearly specified
- [ ] Service contracts documented
- [ ] Test plan comprehensive
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations

TODO:
- [ ] Tasks small (< 30 min each)
- [ ] Tasks sequential
- [ ] Each task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] All PRD requirements covered
- [ ] Testing tasks included
- [ ] References MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md where appropriate

### Step 6: Handoff

**If YOLO: false** (PRD already reviewed):
1. Notify user TODO is complete
2. Provide file paths
3. Summarize TODO breakdown
4. Wait for final approval

**If YOLO: true** (first presentation):
1. Notify user PRD and TODO are ready
2. Provide file paths
3. Summarize key points
4. Wait for user approval

## Best Practices

### Writing Requirements
- ✅ Be specific and measurable
- ✅ Include acceptance criteria
- ✅ Define happy path AND edge cases
- ✅ Consider performance from the start (see MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md)
- ❌ Don't be vague ("make it better")
- ❌ Don't skip error cases

### Writing TODOs
- ✅ Break work into small chunks
- ✅ Start with data/backend, then UI
- ✅ Test as you go (not all at end)
- ✅ Reference MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md for common patterns
- ❌ Don't create giant tasks
- ❌ Don't skip testing steps

### Real-Time Messaging Focus
Every feature MUST address (see MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md for details):
- Device sync
- Latency targets
- Concurrent messages
- Offline behavior

---

## Success Criteria

**PRD complete when:**
- ✅ All sections filled with relevant info
- ✅ Every requirement has acceptance gate
- ✅ Data model and service methods specified
- ✅ Test plan covers all scenarios
- ✅ Risks identified with mitigations
- ✅ If YOLO: false → User approved PRD

**TODO complete when:**
- ✅ All PRD requirements broken into tasks
- ✅ Tasks small and sequential
- ✅ Each task has acceptance criteria
- ✅ Testing and documentation included
- ✅ User approved final deliverables

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Vague requirements → ✅ Specific metrics (see shared-standards.md)  
❌ Missing edge cases → ✅ "What if user is offline?"  
❌ No acceptance criteria → ✅ Define pass/fail gates  
❌ Giant tasks → ✅ Break into 10+ small tasks  
❌ Ignoring sync → ✅ Address real-time requirements  
❌ Forgetting tests → ✅ Include XCTest and XCUITest tasks  
❌ Ignoring YOLO → ✅ Check mode, follow correct workflow

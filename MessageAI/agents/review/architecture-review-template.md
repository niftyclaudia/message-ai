# Architecture Review Agent

**Role**: Review code architecture, patterns, scalability, and technical quality  
**When to Use**: After major features complete, before production deployment  
**Output**: Technical review report with architectural recommendations

---

## Your Mission

Review the codebase architecture for:
1. **Code organization** - Clear folder structure, separation of concerns
2. **Design patterns** - MVVM compliance, service layer design
3. **Data flow** - Firebase integration, state management
4. **Scalability** - Can this handle growth?
5. **Maintainability** - Is code readable and modular?
6. **Security** - Proper secrets management, Firebase rules

## Review Checklist

### Code Organization
- [ ] **Folder structure**: Logical grouping (Services, Views, Models, ViewModels, Utilities)
- [ ] **File naming**: Consistent, descriptive names
- [ ] **File size**: No massive files (>500 lines warrants splitting)
- [ ] **Imports**: No circular dependencies

### Architecture Patterns
- [ ] **MVVM compliance**: Views → ViewModels → Services/Models
- [ ] **Service layer**: Business logic in services, not views
- [ ] **State management**: Proper use of @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject
- [ ] **Dependency injection**: Services injected, not global singletons (where appropriate)

### Swift/SwiftUI Best Practices
- [ ] **Type safety**: Explicit types, avoid `Any`
- [ ] **Error handling**: Proper do/catch, throws, async/await
- [ ] **Optionals**: Safe unwrapping, no force unwraps in production code
- [ ] **Memory management**: No retain cycles, proper `[weak self]` in closures
- [ ] **Threading**: UI on main, heavy work on background

### Firebase Integration
- [ ] **Firestore queries**: Efficient, uses indexes
- [ ] **Real-time listeners**: Properly registered and removed
- [ ] **Batch operations**: Using batches for multiple writes
- [ ] **Offline support**: Firestore persistence enabled
- [ ] **Security rules**: Database, Firestore, Storage rules proper

### AI Architecture (if applicable)
- [ ] **RAG Pipeline**: Vector DB setup, embeddings generated, semantic search working
- [ ] **User Preferences**: Stored in Firestore, loaded into AI prompts
- [ ] **Function Calling**: Functions defined, callable by AI, security validated
- [ ] **Memory/State Management**: Conversation context persisted across interactions
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failures, retry logic, fallback modes

**AI Integration Test**:
- [ ] Can retrieve relevant context (RAG works)
- [ ] Respects user preferences in responses
- [ ] Successfully calls functions (no errors)
- [ ] Remembers context from previous messages
- [ ] Fails gracefully when API down
- [ ] API keys secure in Cloud Functions (not in client code)
- [ ] Cost management: Request limits, caching, batching

### Performance
- [ ] **Lazy loading**: LazyVStack for lists, lazy image loading
- [ ] **Async operations**: Proper async/await usage
- [ ] **No blocking**: Main thread not blocked
- [ ] **Memory leaks**: No obvious retain cycles

### Security
- [ ] **Secrets**: GoogleService-Info.plist not in git
- [ ] **Authentication**: Proper auth checks before operations
- [ ] **Firebase rules**: Users can only access their data
- [ ] **Input validation**: User input sanitized

## Review Process

### 1. Examine Folder Structure
```
MessageAI/MessageAI/
├── Services/          # Business logic
├── Views/             # UI components
├── ViewModels/        # State management
├── Models/            # Data structures
└── Utilities/         # Helpers
```

Check: Is everything in the right place?

### 2. Review Key Files
**Start with these critical files**:
- `MessageAIApp.swift` - App initialization
- Core services: `AuthenticationService.swift`, `MessageService.swift`
- Complex views: `ChatView.swift`, `ConversationListView.swift`
- Firebase rules: `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`

### 3. Check Design Patterns
- Are ViewModels thin coordinators?
- Is business logic in services?
- Are views dumb presenters?
- Is state management clear?

### 4. Review Data Flow
- How does data flow from Firestore → Service → ViewModel → View?
- Are real-time updates handled correctly?
- Is offline sync working?

### 5. Security Audit
- Check Firebase security rules
- Verify secrets not committed
- Validate auth flows

## Key Questions to Ask

1. **Could a new developer understand this codebase in a day?**
2. **What breaks if we go from 100 → 10,000 users?**
3. **Is there a clear separation between UI, logic, and data?**
4. **Can features be added without touching core architecture?**
5. **Are we following Swift/iOS best practices?**
6. **Is security taken seriously (not an afterthought)?**

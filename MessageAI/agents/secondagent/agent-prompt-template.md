## Notes

- **YOLO mode**: Controls whether Planning Agent stops for feedback after PRD
  - `false` = Create PRD → Stop for review → Create TODO after approval
  - `true` = Create both PRD and TODO without stopping

- **Always reference**:
  - `MessageAI/agents/secondagent/shared-standards.md` for common patterns
  - `MessageAI/agents/secondagent/{agent-type}-template.md` for detailed instructions
  - Templates for structure (prd-template.md and test-template.md at root level)

- **Branch strategy**: Always from `secondagent`, PR targets `secondagent`

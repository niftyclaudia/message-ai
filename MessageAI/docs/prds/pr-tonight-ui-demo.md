**Feature**: AI Demo Views (Priority Inbox, Action Items, Decision History, Smart Search)

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready to Build

**Priority**: üî¥ URGENT - Demo Tonight  

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  

**Target Release**: Tonight (October 24, 2025)

**Agent**: Pete (Planning) ‚Üí Cody (Implementation)

**Links**: [Slack Integration PR-011](pr-011-prd.md), [AI Product Vision](../AI-PRODUCT-VISION.md), [Todo List](../todos/pr-tonight-ui-todo.md)

## 1. Summary

Build 4 AI-powered UI views with mock data to demonstrate MessageAI's Calm Intelligence features in a 2-minute stakeholder demo: Priority Inbox (message categorization), Action Items (task extraction), Decision History (FOMO relief), and Smart Search (semantic search).

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

### Problem
Stakeholders need to see all 6 AI features working together in a cohesive demo flow to understand MessageAI's product vision and secure next funding round. Currently, backend AI functions exist but lack user-facing UI for demo.

### Why Now?
Demo scheduled for tonight to showcase Maya's transformation story: from overwhelmed by 200 messages to in control with 2 urgent items in 2 minutes.

### Goals (Ordered by Priority)
- [ ] **G1** ‚Äî Demonstrate Priority Inbox categorization (Urgent/Can Wait/AI Handled) with transparency
- [ ] **G2** ‚Äî Show Action Item extraction from conversations with completion UX
- [ ] **G3** ‚Äî Display Decision History timeline for FOMO relief
- [ ] **G4** ‚Äî Prove Smart Search works with natural language queries
- [ ] **G5** ‚Äî Complete 2-minute walkthrough showcasing all AI features cohesively
- [ ] **G6** ‚Äî Gather stakeholder feedback on Calm Intelligence UX principles

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

Tonight's demo uses **mock data only**. Explicitly NOT doing:

- ‚ùå **Real Firebase backend integration** ‚Äî Use hardcoded mock data arrays
- ‚ùå **Actual AI Cloud Function calls** ‚Äî Mock responses inline in ViewModels
- ‚ùå **Production-ready error handling** ‚Äî Demo happy path only (add error handling in future PR)
- ‚ùå **Full test coverage** ‚Äî Smoke tests only to verify builds run
- ‚ùå **Offline persistence** ‚Äî Not needed for single-device demo
- ‚ùå **Multi-device sync** ‚Äî Single device presentation
- ‚ùå **Real-time Firestore listeners** ‚Äî Static mock data
- ‚ùå **User authentication** ‚Äî Assume logged in user
- ‚ùå **Performance optimization** ‚Äî Small datasets only (<20 items per view)

**Rationale:** Prioritizing visual polish and cohesive demo flow over backend integration to meet tonight's deadline. Production implementation will follow in separate PRs.

---

## üéØ Mission: Show Maya's Complete AI-Powered Day

**Demo Story:**
Maya opens MessageAI after 4-hour focus session ‚Üí Sees prioritized messages ‚Üí Checks action items ‚Üí Searches for decision ‚Üí Reviews decision log ‚Üí Views Slack integration ‚Üí Approves meeting time

**Success Metric:** Complete walkthrough in 2 minutes showing all 6 AI features working

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

- ‚úÖ **Backend**: All Cloud Functions working (categorize, extract, search, track)
- ‚úÖ **Models**: All Swift models exist (MessageCategory, ActionItem, Decision, etc)
- ‚úÖ **Services**: FunctionCallingService with all methods
- ‚úÖ **PR-11**: Slack thread mock with summarization working
- ‚úÖ **Settings**: AI preferences, focus hours, priority rules UI

---

## 8. Data Model (Mock Data Structures)

### PriorityInboxItem
```swift
struct PriorityInboxItem: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let senderName: String
    let senderAvatarURL: String?
    let messagePreview: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let category: MessageCategory
    let reasoning: PriorityReasoning
    let sourceConversationID: String
}

enum MessageCategory: String, CaseIterable {
    case urgent = "Urgent"
    case canWait = "Can Wait"
    case aiHandled = "AI Handled"
}

struct PriorityReasoning {
    let whyUrgent: String
    let confidence: ConfidenceLevel
    let signals: [String]
    let evidenceMessageID: String
}

enum ConfidenceLevel: String {

struct ActionItem: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let text: String
    let fromPerson: String
    let chatName: String
    let deadline: Date?
    let urgency: ActionItemUrgency
    let sourceMessageID: String
    let sourceConversationID: String
    let extractionReasoning: ExtractionReasoning
    var isCompleted: Bool = false
}

enum ActionItemUrgency: String, CaseIterable {
    case today = "Today"
    case thisWeek = "This Week"
    case later = "Later"
}

struct ExtractionReasoning {
    let why: String
    let signals: [String]
    let sourceExcerpt: String

    let id: String
    let messagePreview: String
    let senderName: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let chatName: String
    let chatID: String
    let messageID: String
    let relevanceScore: Double // 0.0 to 1.0
    let matchedKeywords: [String]
}
```

**Note:** Tonight using in-memory arrays. Future production will use Firestore documents with these schemas.

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

Tonight using **mock implementations**. Future production will connect to Firebase/Cloud Functions.

### PriorityInboxService Protocol
```swift
protocol PriorityInboxService {
    /// Fetch categorized messages (mock returns hardcoded array)
    func fetchInbox() async throws -> [PriorityInboxItem]
    
    /// Manually recategorize a message (mock updates local array)
    func recategorizeMessage(messageID: String, newCategory: MessageCategory) async throws
    
    /// Refresh inbox (mock re-sorts existing data)
    func refreshInbox() async throws -> [PriorityInboxItem]
}
```

### ActionItemService Protocol
```swift
protocol ActionItemService {
    /// Fetch all action items grouped by urgency (mock returns 7-8 hardcoded tasks)
    func fetchActionItems() async throws -> [ActionItem]
    
    /// Mark action item as complete (mock updates isCompleted flag)
    func completeActionItem(id: String) async throws
    
    /// Fetch action items filtered by urgency
    func fetchActionItems(urgency: ActionItemUrgency) async throws -> [ActionItem]
}
```

### DecisionHistoryService Protocol
```swift
protocol DecisionHistoryService {
    /// Fetch decisions with optional time filter (mock returns 5-6 decisions)
    func fetchDecisions(filter: TimeFilter) async throws -> [Decision]
    
    /// Search decisions by natural language query (mock filters by keyword)
    func searchDecisions(query: String) async throws -> [Decision]
}

enum TimeFilter: String, CaseIterable {
    case lastWeek = "Last Week"
    case lastMonth = "Last Month"
    case allTime = "All Time"
}
```

### SmartSearchService Protocol
```swift
protocol SmartSearchService {
    /// Semantic search (mock returns keyword-matched results with fake relevance scores)
    func search(query: String) async throws -> [SearchResult]
}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Tonight: Create `Mock[Service]` classes that return hardcoded arrays
- Production: Create `Firebase[Service]` classes that call Cloud Functions + Firestore
- ViewModels depend on protocols, making it easy to swap implementations

---

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

### New Files to Create
- `Views/AI/PriorityInboxView.swift` ‚Äî Main priority inbox screen with 3 sections
- `ViewModels/AI/PriorityInboxViewModel.swift` ‚Äî Manages inbox state and mock data
- `Views/AI/ActionItemsView.swift` ‚Äî Action items sheet modal with grouped tasks
- `ViewModels/AI/ActionItemsViewModel.swift` ‚Äî Manages action items state and completion
- `Views/AI/DecisionHistoryView.swift` ‚Äî Timeline view of tracked decisions
- `ViewModels/AI/DecisionHistoryViewModel.swift` ‚Äî Manages decision history state and filtering
- `Views/AI/SmartSearchView.swift` ‚Äî Enhanced search with semantic results
- `ViewModels/AI/SmartSearchViewModel.swift` ‚Äî Manages search state and mock results
- `Components/AI/ReasoningModal.swift` ‚Äî Reusable transparency modal for AI explanations
- `Components/AI/CalmEmptyStateView.swift` ‚Äî Reusable empty state component

### Files to Modify
- `Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift` ‚Äî Add navigation links to Priority Inbox and Decision History
- `Views/ConversationListView.swift` ‚Äî Add toolbar button for Action Items sheet

---

## 11. Threading & Concurrency

**Tonight (Mock Data):**
- All data synchronous (no threading needed)
- ViewModels use `@MainActor` and `@Published` for SwiftUI reactivity

**Future Production:** Follow Swift concurrency best practices - background threads for Firestore/AI calls, main thread for UI updates via `@MainActor`

---

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

### Tonight (Smoke Tests Only)
- [ ] All 4 views build and run without errors
- [ ] Complete demo script runs in < 2 minutes  
- [ ] No crashes or visual glitches
- [ ] Dark mode works correctly
- [ ] Navigation and tap interactions functional
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (see Priority 1-4 sections above)

### Future Production (Add Before Launch)
- **Unit Tests:** ViewModel tests using Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`)
- **UI Tests:** Navigation and interaction tests using XCTest
- **Coverage Target:** 80%+ for ViewModels, key flows covered in UI tests

See `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for detailed testing requirements.

---

## 13. Performance Requirements

**Tonight (Mock Data):** Instant loads (<300ms), 60fps animations, small datasets

**Future Production:** Must meet Phase 1 targets - View load <400ms, AI operations p95 <2s, scrolling 60fps with 1000+ messages. See `shared-standards.md` for details.

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Mock data doesn't reflect real AI behavior** | Demo feels fake, stakeholders skeptical | Use realistic examples based on actual Cloud Function outputs; show transparency reasoning |
| **4 views in 3-4 hours is aggressive** | Not ready for demo | Prioritize PriorityInboxView (hero feature) first; cut SmartSearch if time runs out |
| **Dark mode issues** | Demo looks unprofessional | Test dark mode for each view before moving to next; use semantic colors |
| **Animations feel janky** | Violates Calm Intelligence principles | Use 300-400ms spring animations consistently; test on physical device |
| **Navigation breaks existing app** | Can't show full demo flow | Test complete demo script after each view integration |
| **Stakeholders want to interact (not just watch)** | Mock data breaks if they deviate from script | Add error handling for unexpected taps; guide demo with narration |
| **Demo runs long (>2 minutes)** | Lose stakeholder attention | Practice demo script 3x; cut steps if needed |

---

## 15. Integration Points

**Tonight:** Mock services, SwiftUI state management, NavigationLink + sheets for navigation

**Future:** Connect to Firebase (Firestore + Cloud Functions), use existing `FunctionCallingService`

---

## üé® Calm Intelligence Design Standards

### Colors (Use Throughout)
```swift
// Urgent
Color(hex: "#FF6B6B") // Soft red, not harsh

NavigationLink("Priority Inbox") {
    PriorityInboxView()
}
NavigationLink("Decision History") {
    DecisionHistoryView()
}
NavigationLink("Slack Integration (Demo)") {
    MockSlackThreadView() // Already exists
}
```

### Add to ConversationListView
```swift

    // Action Items button
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
        Button { showActionItems = true } {
            Image(systemName: "checklist")
        }
    }
}

// Sheets:
.sheet(isPresented: $showActionItems) {
    ActionItemsView()
}
```

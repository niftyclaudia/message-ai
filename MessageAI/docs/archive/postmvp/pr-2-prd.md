# PRD: Offline Persistence & Sync System

**Feature**: Offline Persistence & Sync System

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Agent**: Pete

**Target Release**: Phase 1

**Links**: [PR Brief], [TODO], [Designs], [Tracking Issue]

---

## 1. Summary

Implement comprehensive offline messaging system with 3-message queue in Airplane Mode that auto-sends on reconnect, force-quit scenario preservation of full message history, network drop handling with 30s+ auto-reconnect and sync < 1s, and clear UI states for Connecting/Offline/Sending X messages to keep users informed of system status.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

- **User Problem**: Users lose messages when offline, experience data loss during app crashes, and lack visibility into message delivery status during network issues
- **Why Now**: Essential foundation for reliable messaging that works in real-world conditions with poor connectivity, airplane mode, and app lifecycle events
- **Goals (ordered, measurable)**:
  - [ ] G1 — Achieve 3-message offline queue that persists through app restarts and auto-sends on reconnect
  - [ ] G2 — Ensure zero message loss during force-quit scenarios with full history preservation
  - [ ] G3 — Implement network resilience with 30s+ auto-reconnect and sync completion < 1s
  - [ ] G4 — Provide clear UI feedback for all connection states (Connecting/Offline/Sending X messages)

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not implementing message encryption (handled by Firebase)
- [ ] Not building custom offline database (using Firestore offline persistence)
- [ ] Not implementing message compression for offline storage
- [ ] Not building custom sync algorithms (leveraging Firebase sync)

---

## 4. Success Metrics

Reference `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for metric templates:
- **User-visible**: Offline queue visible, connection status clear, zero message loss
- **System**: 3-message queue capacity, < 1s sync on reconnect, 30s+ network resilience
- **Performance**: Offline persistence enabled, force-quit recovery, auto-reconnect < 30s
- **Quality**: 0 blocking bugs, all gates pass, crash-free rate >99%

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **mobile user**, I want my messages to queue when offline so that I don't lose important communications
- As a **remote worker**, I want to see my message delivery status so that I know when my messages are sent
- As a **frequent traveler**, I want my messages to auto-send when I reconnect so that I don't have to manually retry
- As a **power user**, I want my full message history preserved after crashes so that I don't lose conversation context

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

- **Entry points and flows**: Automatic when network state changes, visible in message input area
- **Visual behavior**: 
  - "Queued" indicator for offline messages
  - "Connecting..." spinner during reconnection
  - "Sending 3 messages..." progress indicator
  - "Offline" banner when disconnected
- **Loading/disabled/error states**: 
  - Input disabled when offline (except for queuing)
  - Clear visual feedback for all states
  - Retry mechanism for failed syncs
- **Performance**: See targets in `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

- **MUST**: Implement 3-message offline queue that persists through app restarts
- **MUST**: Auto-send queued messages on network reconnect
- **MUST**: Preserve full message history during force-quit scenarios
- **MUST**: Handle network drops with 30s+ auto-reconnect capability
- **MUST**: Complete sync in < 1s after reconnection
- **MUST**: Provide clear UI states for all connection statuses
- **SHOULD**: Implement optimistic UI for queued messages
- **SHOULD**: Show progress indicators for bulk message sending

**Acceptance gates per requirement:**
- [Gate] When user goes offline → messages queue locally and show "Queued" status
- [Gate] When user reconnects → queued messages auto-send within 1s
- [Gate] When app force-quits offline → full history preserved on restart
- [Gate] When network drops for 30s+ → auto-reconnect and sync completes < 1s
- [Gate] When offline → UI shows "Offline" banner and "Queued" indicators
- [Gate] When reconnecting → UI shows "Connecting..." and "Sending X messages..."

## 8. Data Model

Describe new/changed Firestore collections, schemas, invariants.

Reference examples in `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for common patterns.

```swift
// Offline Queue Document (local storage)
struct OfflineMessage {
    let id: String
    let chatID: String
    let text: String
    let senderID: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let status: MessageStatus // .queued, .sending, .sent, .failed
}

// Message Status Enum
enum MessageStatus {
    case queued
    case sending
    case sent
    case failed
}

// Connection State
enum ConnectionState {
    case online
    case offline
    case connecting
    case syncing(Int) // number of messages being sent
}
```

- **Validation rules**: Offline messages stored locally, Firestore security rules unchanged
- **Indexing/queries**: Local Core Data/SQLite for offline queue, Firestore listeners for real-time sync

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

Specify concrete service layer methods. Reference examples in `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

```swift
// Offline Queue Management
func queueMessageOffline(chatID: String, text: String) async throws -> String
func getOfflineMessages() async throws -> [OfflineMessage]
func clearOfflineMessages() async throws

// Network State Management
func observeNetworkState() -> AsyncStream<ConnectionState>
func isOnline() async -> Bool
func waitForConnection() async throws

// Sync Operations
func syncOfflineMessages() async throws -> Int // returns count of synced messages
func retryFailedMessages() async throws -> Int

// Message Status Updates
func updateMessageStatus(messageID: String, status: MessageStatus) async throws
func observeMessageStatus(messageID: String) -> AsyncStream<MessageStatus>
```

- **Pre/post-conditions**: Network state checked before operations, offline queue persisted locally
- **Error handling strategy**: Retry failed messages, show user feedback for permanent failures
- **Parameters and types**: All methods async/await, proper error handling
- **Return values**: Message IDs, status updates, sync counts

---

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

List SwiftUI views/files with one-line purpose each.

- `Views/OfflineIndicator.swift` — Shows offline status banner
- `Views/MessageQueueStatus.swift` — Displays queued message count and status
- `Views/ConnectionStatusView.swift` — Shows connecting/syncing states
- `Services/OfflineMessageService.swift` — Manages offline queue operations
- `Services/NetworkMonitorService.swift` — Monitors network connectivity
- `Services/SyncService.swift` — Handles message synchronization
- `ViewModels/OfflineViewModel.swift` — Manages offline state and UI updates
- `Models/OfflineMessage.swift` — Data model for queued messages
- `Utilities/NetworkReachability.swift` — Network connectivity detection

---

## 11. Integration Points

- **Firebase Authentication** — User context for offline messages
- **Firestore** — Real-time sync and message storage
- **Firebase Realtime Database** — Connection state tracking
- **FCM** — Push notifications for offline message delivery
- **State management** — SwiftUI @StateObject for connection status
- **Local Storage** — Core Data/SQLite for offline queue persistence

---

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

Define BEFORE implementation. Use checkboxes.

Reference testing standards from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- **Happy Path**
  - [ ] User goes offline → messages queue locally
  - [ ] User reconnects → queued messages auto-send
  - [ ] Gate: All queued messages sent within 1s of reconnection
  
- **Edge Cases**
  - [ ] App force-quit while offline → messages preserved on restart
  - [ ] Network drops for 30s+ → auto-reconnect works
  - [ ] Gate: Zero message loss during force-quit scenarios
  
- **Multi-User**
  - [ ] Offline messages sync across devices
  - [ ] Real-time status updates propagate
  - [ ] Gate: Offline queue syncs < 200ms across devices
  
- **Performance (see shared-standards.md)**
  - [ ] 3-message queue capacity maintained
  - [ ] Sync completion < 1s after reconnection
  - [ ] UI remains responsive during sync operations

---

## 13. Definition of Done

See standards in `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`:
- [ ] Offline message service implemented + unit tests (Swift Testing)
- [ ] Network monitoring service with connection state management
- [ ] SwiftUI views for all offline states (offline, connecting, syncing)
- [ ] Real-time sync verified across 2+ devices
- [ ] Offline persistence tested with force-quit scenarios
- [ ] All acceptance gates pass
- [ ] Performance targets met (3-message queue, < 1s sync)
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Offline queue corruption → **Mitigation**: Implement data validation and recovery mechanisms
- **Risk**: Sync conflicts during rapid reconnection → **Mitigation**: Implement sync queuing and conflict resolution
- **Risk**: Performance impact of offline storage → **Mitigation**: Use efficient local storage and limit queue size
- **Risk**: Network state detection false positives → **Mitigation**: Implement robust network monitoring with retry logic
- **Risk**: Message ordering issues during sync → **Mitigation**: Use timestamps and sequence numbers for proper ordering

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

- **Feature flag**: No (core functionality)
- **Metrics**: Offline queue size, sync success rate, connection state duration, message loss rate
- **Manual validation steps**: Test offline scenarios, force-quit recovery, network transitions

---

## 16. Open Questions

- Q1: Should we implement message compression for offline storage?
- Q2: What's the maximum acceptable offline queue size beyond 3 messages?

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

Items deferred for future:
- [ ] Message encryption for offline storage
- [ ] Advanced sync conflict resolution
- [ ] Offline message search capabilities
- [ ] Bulk message operations while offline

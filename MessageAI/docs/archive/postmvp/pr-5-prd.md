# PRD: Performance & UX Optimization

**Feature**: Performance & UX Optimization

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Draft

**Agent**: Pete

**Target Release**: Phase 1

**Links**: [PR Brief], [TODO], [Designs], [Tracking Issue]

---

## 1. Summary

Achieve excellent performance metrics with cold launch < 2s and navigation < 400ms, implement 60 FPS scrolling with 1000+ messages using list windowing techniques, add optimistic UI with instant feedback and retry on failure, and optimize keyboard handling to eliminate jank and keep input pinned. Deliver professional polish throughout the user experience.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

- **What user problem are we solving?** Current app may have performance issues that create poor user experience - slow app launches, laggy navigation, choppy scrolling with many messages, and unresponsive UI during interactions. Users expect professional-grade performance in a messaging app.

- **Why now?** This is the final Phase 1 PR that builds on all previous performance optimizations (PR #1-4) to deliver the complete polished experience. Without this optimization, the app will feel unprofessional and users will experience frustration with slow interactions.

- **Goals (ordered, measurable):**
  - [ ] G1 — Achieve cold launch < 2s and navigation < 400ms for professional responsiveness
  - [ ] G2 — Implement 60 FPS scrolling with 1000+ messages using list windowing
  - [ ] G3 — Add optimistic UI with instant feedback and retry on failure mechanisms
  - [ ] G4 — Optimize keyboard handling to eliminate jank and keep input pinned
  - [ ] G5 — Deliver professional polish throughout the user experience

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not implementing new messaging features (covered in previous PRs)
- [ ] Not adding AI capabilities (covered in Phase 3)
- [ ] Not implementing advanced offline features beyond existing queue
- [ ] Not adding new UI components or major design changes

---

## 4. Success Metrics

Reference `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for metric templates:
- **User-visible**: Cold launch < 2s, navigation < 400ms, smooth 60fps scrolling, instant UI feedback
- **System**: App load < 2s, navigation < 400ms, 60fps with 1000+ messages, optimistic UI response < 50ms
- **Performance**: Burst messaging (20+ messages), presence propagation < 500ms, keyboard handling optimization
- **Quality**: 0 blocking bugs, all gates pass, crash-free rate >99%

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **remote worker**, I want the app to launch quickly so that I can start messaging immediately when I need to communicate.
- As a **frequent user**, I want smooth scrolling through long conversations so that I can find information quickly without lag.
- As a **mobile user**, I want instant feedback when I interact with the app so that I know my actions are being processed.
- As a **professional**, I want the app to feel polished and responsive so that I can use it confidently in work settings.

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

- **Entry points and flows**: App launch, navigation between screens, scrolling through messages, typing interactions
- **Visual behavior**: 
  - Instant app launch with smooth splash screen
  - Smooth navigation transitions
  - Fluid scrolling with proper list windowing
  - Immediate UI feedback for all interactions
  - Optimistic message sending with instant visual feedback
- **Loading/disabled/error states**: 
  - Fast loading states with skeleton screens
  - Instant retry mechanisms for failed operations
  - Smooth error state transitions
- **Performance**: See targets in `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` - < 2s launch, < 400ms navigation, 60fps scrolling

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

- **MUST**: Achieve cold launch < 2s from app icon tap to interactive UI
- **MUST**: Implement navigation < 400ms between all screens
- **MUST**: Deliver 60 FPS scrolling with 1000+ messages using list windowing
- **MUST**: Implement optimistic UI with instant feedback for all user actions
- **MUST**: Optimize keyboard handling to eliminate jank and keep input pinned
- **SHOULD**: Add retry mechanisms for failed operations with smooth transitions
- **SHOULD**: Implement skeleton screens for loading states

**Acceptance gates per requirement:**
- [Gate] App launch → Interactive UI available in < 2s
- [Gate] Navigation between screens → Transition completes in < 400ms
- [Gate] Scrolling 1000+ messages → Maintains 60fps with list windowing
- [Gate] User interaction → UI responds instantly with optimistic feedback
- [Gate] Keyboard appearance → No jank, input stays pinned and responsive
- [Gate] Failed operation → Retry mechanism works smoothly with user feedback

---

## 8. Data Model

No new Firestore collections required. Optimize existing data access patterns:

```swift
// Message List Optimization (existing, optimize access)
struct MessageListConfig {
    let windowSize: Int = 50  // Load 50 messages at a time
    let prefetchThreshold: Int = 10  // Prefetch when 10 from end
    let maxCachedMessages: Int = 200  // Keep 200 in memory
}

// Performance Monitoring (new)
struct PerformanceMetrics {
    let launchTime: TimeInterval
    let navigationTime: TimeInterval
    let scrollFPS: Double
    let uiResponseTime: TimeInterval
}

// Optimistic UI State (new)
enum UIState {
    case idle
    case optimistic(operation: String)
    case loading
    case error(message: String)
    case retrying(attempt: Int)
}
```

- **Validation rules**: Existing Firebase security rules apply
- **Indexing/queries**: Optimize Firestore queries with proper indexes, implement list windowing for message loading

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

Specify concrete service layer methods for performance optimization:

```swift
// Performance Monitoring
func measureLaunchTime() async -> TimeInterval
func measureNavigationTime(from: String, to: String) async -> TimeInterval
func measureScrollPerformance() async -> Double // FPS
func measureUIResponseTime(action: String) async -> TimeInterval

// List Windowing for Messages
func loadMessageWindow(chatID: String, startIndex: Int, windowSize: Int) async throws -> [Message]
func prefetchMessages(chatID: String, currentIndex: Int) async throws
func clearMessageCache(chatID: String) async throws

// Optimistic UI Operations
func performOptimisticAction<T>(action: () async throws -> T, fallback: T) async -> T
func retryFailedOperation<T>(operation: () async throws -> T, maxRetries: Int) async throws -> T
func updateUIState(_ state: UIState) async

// Keyboard Optimization
func optimizeKeyboardHandling() async
func handleKeyboardTransition() async
func maintainInputFocus() async
```

- **Pre/post-conditions**: All methods must complete within performance targets
- **Error handling strategy**: Optimistic UI with retry mechanisms, graceful degradation
- **Parameters and types**: Async/await with proper error handling, performance monitoring
- **Return values**: Performance metrics, operation results, state updates

## Authoring Notes

- Write Test Plan before coding
- Favor vertical slice that ships standalone
- Keep service layer deterministic
- SwiftUI views are thin wrappers
- Test performance thoroughly with real data
- Reference `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` throughout

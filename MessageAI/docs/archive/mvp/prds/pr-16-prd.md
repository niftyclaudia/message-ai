# PRD: Bug Fixing & UI Polish

**Feature**: Production Readiness & Final Polish

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Agent**: Pete

**Target Release**: Phase 4 (Final)

**Links**: [PR Brief: PR #16](../pr-brief/pr-briefs.md), [TODO: pr-16-todo.md](../todos/pr-16-todo.md), [Dependencies: All PRs #1-15]

## 1. Summary

Conduct comprehensive bug fixing, UI polish, and final quality assurance across all app features to ensure production-ready quality. This PR focuses on identifying and resolving bugs, improving UI consistency, optimizing performance, and validating that all features work seamlessly together before launch.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

**Problem:** All core features (auth, messaging, groups, presence, notifications) are implemented but need final polish, bug fixes, and quality validation before production release. Edge cases, UI inconsistencies, and integration issues may exist that weren't caught during individual feature development.

**Why Now:** Phase 4 final step. All features complete; this is the production-readiness gate before launch.

**Goals:**
- [x] G1 — Identify and fix all critical and high-priority bugs (0 P0/P1 bugs remaining)
- [x] G2 — Achieve consistent UI/UX across all screens with polished interactions
- [x] G3 — Validate app meets all performance targets and quality standards for production

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- [ ] Not implementing new features (only fixing/polishing existing)
- [ ] Not implementing advanced features deferred to future versions
- [ ] Not implementing custom analytics dashboard
- [ ] Not implementing app store marketing materials
- [ ] Not implementing backend infrastructure scaling

---

## 4. Success Metrics

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

**R1: Bugs Found Late in Process** → Prioritize by severity; defer P3 bugs to post-launch; focus on P0/P1  
**R2: Performance Regressions** → Establish baseline benchmarks early; profile frequently; optimize incrementally  
**R3: Scope Creep (Feature Requests)** → Strict "bug fixes and polish only" policy; defer features to backlog  
**R4: Time Constraints** → Focus on P0/P1 bugs first; create "nice to fix" list for future  
**R5: Testing Coverage Gaps** → Prioritize critical user journeys; automate where possible; manual testing for edge cases  
**R6: Platform-Specific Issues** → Test on multiple devices and iOS versions; use TestFlight for broader testing

## 16. Open Questions

**Q1: Should we implement analytics in this PR or defer to post-launch?** → Recommend basic analytics (crashes, performance) now; defer advanced analytics

**Q2: What's the process for P2/P3 bugs found but not fixed?** → Document in known-issues.md; create tickets for backlog; inform users in release notes if user-facing

**Q3: Should we do TestFlight beta before App Store submission?** → Recommended for final validation with real users

**Q4: What's the minimum iOS version we're targeting?** → Recommend iOS 15+ (matches SwiftUI features used)

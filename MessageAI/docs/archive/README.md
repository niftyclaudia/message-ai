# Archive

This folder contains historical documents, deprecated PRDs, and outdated planning materials that are no longer actively referenced but preserved for historical context.

## Purpose

- **Historical Reference**: Maintain a record of past decisions and iterations
- **Learning**: Review how features and architecture evolved over time
- **Context**: Understand why certain approaches were taken or abandoned

## Organization

Archive files should maintain their original structure when moved here. Consider adding a date suffix to filenames (e.g., `feature-prd-2024-10.md`) to indicate when they were archived.

## When to Archive

Move documents here when:
- Features have been fully implemented and documentation is superseded by newer versions
- PRDs are outdated or projects were cancelled
- Planning documents are no longer relevant to current development
- Documents are being replaced by updated versions

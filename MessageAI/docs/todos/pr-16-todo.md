## Notes

- **Quality Over Speed:** This PR is about quality, not features. Take time to be thorough.
- **Physical Devices Required:** Many tests (notifications, performance) need real iPhones.
- **Systematic Approach:** Follow the bug hunting phases systematically; don't skip categories.
- **Document Everything:** Bug tracker and test results are critical for confidence.
- **Prioritization:** P0 bugs MUST be fixed; P1 should be fixed; P2/P3 can be deferred.
- **Performance Baselines:** Document benchmarks for future regression testing.
- **No New Features:** Strict policy - fixes and polish only, no feature additions.
- **User Approval Required:** DO NOT submit to App Store without explicit user approval.
- **TestFlight Recommended:** Consider beta testing before public release.
- **Launch Checklist:** PRD Section 13 is your final gate - all items must be checked.

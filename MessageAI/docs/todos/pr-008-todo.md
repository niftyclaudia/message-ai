# PR-008 TODO ‚Äî Repository Setup & Documentation

**Branch**: `feat/pr-008-repository-setup`  
**Source PRD**: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-008-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Cody

---

## 0. Assumptions

- Individual Firebase projects (not shared dev project)
- Text-only documentation (no video tutorials)
- macOS required for iOS development
- Xcode installed manually (too large for automation)

---

## 1. Setup

- [ ] Create branch `feat/pr-008-repository-setup` from develop
- [ ] Read PRD thoroughly (`MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-008-prd.md`)
- [ ] Read `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
- [ ] Audit existing documentation (README.md, functions/README.md)

---

## 2. Environment Templates

- [ ] Create `.env.template` in root (Node.js version, Firebase project)
- [ ] Enhance `functions/.env.template` with OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT, PINECONE_INDEX + inline comments
- [ ] Verify `MessageAI/MessageAI/GoogleService-Info.template.plist` has clear REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_* placeholders

---

## 3. Setup Script

- [ ] Create `setup.sh` with bash shebang, `set -e`, color output (‚úì ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚úó)
- [ ] Add prerequisite checks:
  - macOS version (min Monterey 12.0)
  - Xcode installation (`xcode-select -p`)
  - Node.js version (min 18.0)
  - Architecture detection (Intel vs M1/M2)
- [ ] Add dependency installation:
  - Root npm packages (`npm install`)
  - Firebase CLI globally (if missing)
  - Cloud Functions packages (`cd functions && npm install`)
- [ ] Add configuration checks:
  - GoogleService-Info.plist (warn if missing)
  - functions/.env (warn if missing, optional)
- [ ] Add setup summary showing success/warnings and next steps (exit 0 if warnings OK, exit 1 if critical errors)

---

## 4. Configuration Validation Script

- [ ] Create `validate-config.sh` with bash shebang and error handling
- [ ] Validate GoogleService-Info.plist:
  - Check file exists
  - Detect placeholder values (`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_`)
  - Validate required fields (PROJECT_ID, API_KEY, GCM_SENDER_ID, APP_ID, STORAGE_BUCKET, CLIENT_ID)
- [ ] Validate functions/.env (if present): warn about missing OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, etc.
- [ ] Print validation summary with error count and suggested fixes

---

## 5. NPM Scripts

- [ ] Update `package.json` with scripts: setup, validate:config, open:xcode, dev, dev:functions, test:all, test:ios, test:functions, health-check
- [ ] Test all scripts work: setup installs deps, validate detects config issues, open:xcode opens project, dev starts emulators, test:all runs tests

---

## 6. Enhanced README

- [ ] Add "üöÄ Quick Start (10 Minutes)" section with 5 numbered steps: Prerequisites, Clone, Setup, Configure, Build
- [ ] Add prerequisites checklist: macOS Monterey+, Xcode 15.0+, Node.js 18.0+, npm 9.0+, Git (with install links)
- [ ] Document setup steps:
  - Clone repo and cd into directory
  - Run `npm run setup` with explanation
  - Firebase configuration (copy template ‚Üí get credentials ‚Üí replace placeholders ‚Üí validate)
  - Cloud Functions setup (optional, link to functions/README.md)
- [ ] Document first build: `npm run open:xcode` ‚Üí Cmd+R in simulator
- [ ] Add development workflow section with npm scripts table and Firebase emulator usage
- [ ] Add architecture overview with system diagram and file structure (link to architecture.md)

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

- [ ] Create `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with table of contents
- [ ] Document Firebase issues (3):
  - GoogleService-Info.plist not found ‚Üí copy template
  - Firebase config invalid ‚Üí run validate:config
  - Firebase auth failed ‚Üí re-download from console
- [ ] Document build issues (3):
  - CodeSign failed ‚Üí sign in with Apple ID
  - Module 'Firebase' not found ‚Üí reset package caches
  - Linker errors ‚Üí clean build folder
- [ ] Document Cloud Functions issues (3):
  - Emulators won't start ‚Üí kill ports or change ports
  - OpenAI API key invalid ‚Üí regenerate key
  - Pinecone connection failed ‚Üí verify API key
- [ ] Document system issues (3):
  - Xcode not found ‚Üí install from App Store
  - Node.js too old ‚Üí install 18+ or use nvm
  - Permission denied ‚Üí chmod +x scripts
- [ ] Add "Getting Help" section with support resources

**Feature**: Focus Mode Toggle & Two-Section List View  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Core Implementation Done (Tests Pending)  
**Agent**: Cody  
**Target Release**: January 2025  
**Commit**: 4b6aa7c

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Issue: Flow Mode Not Showing Urgent Messages in Priority Section
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Root Cause**: 
1. UI wasn't reactive to classification status changes
2. Initial chat load wasn't populating classification data

**Fix**: 
1. Added reactive observation of `classificationStatus` in `ConversationListView`
2. Added call to `populateClassificationDataForChats` in initial `loadChats` method
3. Added debug logging to track classification updates

**Files Modified**:
- `MessageAI/MessageAI/Views/Main/ConversationListView.swift`
- `MessageAI/MessageAI/ViewModels/ConversationListViewModel.swift`
- `MessageAI/MessageAI/Services/AIClassificationService.swift`

## üéØ Overview

Build the Focus Mode UI foundation with an inline toggle switch and two-section conversation list (Priority / HOLDING). Users can activate Focus Mode to filter messages into priority and non-priority sections, with a clean placeholder state for held messages.

  - [x] Implement state persistence across app restarts
  - [x] Add state validation on app launch
  - [x] Handle corrupted state gracefully
  - [ ] Test state persistence thoroughly (manual testing only)

- [x] **4.2** SwiftUI State Management ‚úÖ
  - [x] Ensure @Published properties update UI reactively
  - [x] Handle state changes during app backgrounding/foregrounding
  - [ ] Test state consistency across different app states (pending)

### Phase 5: Performance & Polish
- [x] **5.1** Animation Optimization ‚úÖ
  - [x] Ensure 60fps animations during toggle
  - [x] Optimize section transitions
  - [ ] Test with large message lists (100+ messages) (pending)
  - [ ] Profile with Instruments for performance (pending)

- [x] **5.2** Error Handling & Edge Cases ‚úÖ
  - [x] Handle empty priority messages state
  - [x] Handle empty holding messages state (hide section)
  - [x] Handle filtering failures gracefully
  - [ ] Test memory pressure scenarios (pending)

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **6.1** Unit Tests
  - [ ] FocusModeService comprehensive test coverage
  - [ ] Model validation tests
  - [ ] State persistence tests

- [ ] **6.2** Integration Tests
  - [ ] End-to-end toggle functionality
  - [ ] State persistence across app restarts
  - [ ] Performance under load (100 toggle cycles)

- [ ] **6.3** UI Tests
  - [ ] Toggle switch interaction
  - [ ] Section transitions
  - [ ] Empty state handling
  - [ ] Accessibility testing

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Gates

### Performance Gates
- [ ] **Gate 1**: Toggle Focus Mode ‚Üí sections appear/disappear in <300ms
- [ ] **Gate 2**: Focus Mode ON ‚Üí messages filter into correct sections
- [ ] **Gate 3**: Focus Mode OFF ‚Üí all messages show in single list
- [ ] **Gate 4**: Kill app and restart ‚Üí Focus Mode state preserved
- [ ] **Gate 5**: 100 toggle cycles ‚Üí no crashes or memory leaks

### Functional Gates
- [ ] **Gate 6**: Toggle responds immediately with visual feedback
- [ ] **Gate 7**: State persists across app restarts and backgrounding
- [ ] **Gate 8**: Two-section layout when Focus Mode active, single section when inactive
- [ ] **Gate 9**: Smooth slide animations between sections
- [ ] **Gate 10**: Graceful error handling if message filtering fails

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Gate 11**: UI animations smooth at 60fps
- [ ] **Gate 12**: No blocking bugs
- [ ] **Gate 13**: All unit tests pass
- [ ] **Gate 14**: All integration tests pass
- [ ] **Gate 15**: All UI tests pass

## üé® Design Specifications

### Toggle Switch States
- **Active**: Teal background with white handle on right
- **Inactive**: Dark gray background with handle on left
- **Flow Mode Indicator**: Small teal dot (‚óè) next to "Flow Mode" text when active

### Section Layouts
- **Focus Mode OFF**: Single conversation list showing all messages
- **Focus Mode ON**: Two-section list:
  - **PRIORITY (X)**: Messages with `priority: "urgent"`
  - **HOLDING (X)**: Placeholder card with "Messages are waiting quietly for you"

### Empty States
- **No priority messages**: "No urgent messages right now"
- **No holding messages**: Hide HOLDING section entirely

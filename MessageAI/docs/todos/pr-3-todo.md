**Branch**: `feat/pr-3-group-chat-enhancement`  
**Source PRD**: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-3-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Pete

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**: 
  - Should we show avatars for all messages or only the first in a sequence from the same sender?
    - **Answer from PRD**: Show avatar for all group messages for maximum clarity (can optimize later)
  - Should member list show "last seen" timestamp for offline users?
    - **Answer from PRD**: Defer to future PR, focus on online/offline status only for Phase 1
  - Maximum supported group size for Phase 1?
    - **Answer from PRD**: Focus on 3-10 members, test up to 20 for validation

- **Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed)**:
  - PR #1 (Real-Time Message Delivery Optimization) is complete and working
  - Existing typing indicators and read receipts are functional
  - Existing PresenceService supports multi-user observation
  - User profile data (name, avatar) is available in Firestore
  - Group chat creation flow (from MVP) is complete and functional

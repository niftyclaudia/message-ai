## Notes & Tips

**Break tasks into <30 min chunks:**
- Setup + Data Models: 10 min
- Service + ViewModel: 20 min
- Main View + Cards: 30 min
- Animations + Modal: 15 min
- Integration + Testing: 20 min

**Reference materials:**
- PR Brief: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-action-items-brief.md` (copy-paste ready code)
- Shared Standards: `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` (Swift patterns)
- Parent PRD: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-tonight-ui-demo.md` (full context)

**Why this matters:**
This is **Maya's breakthrough moment** - she returns after 4-hour focus ‚Üí opens Action Items ‚Üí sees 2 tasks for today (not 200 messages) ‚Üí in control in 30 seconds.

**Critical UX:** The completion animation must feel **satisfying and calm**, not rushed. Make those checkmarks feel *chef's kiss* good! ‚ú®

**Document blockers immediately** - ping if stuck >15 min

**Status:** Ready to build  
**Next:** Mark "Setup" tasks as in-progress and begin! üöÄ

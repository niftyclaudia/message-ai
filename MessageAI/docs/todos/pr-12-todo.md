# PR-12 TODO — Message Read Receipts

**Branch**: `feat/pr-12-message-read-receipts`  
**Source PRD**: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-12-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Pete

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**: 
  - Should read receipts be batched for performance optimization?
  - Should we implement read receipt privacy controls in this PR?
- **Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed)**:
  - Read receipts are automatically triggered when user views messages (no manual action required)
  - Read receipts work with existing optimistic UI system
  - Read receipts are only for 1-on-1 chats (group chat read receipts are future feature)

- [x] Add Firestore indexes for read receipt queries ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipt queries perform efficiently ✅

---

## 4. UI Components

Create/modify SwiftUI views per PRD Section 10.

- [x] Create `Views/Components/ReadReceiptIndicatorView.swift` ✅
  - Test Gate: SwiftUI Preview renders; zero console errors ✅
- [x] Update `Views/Components/MessageRowView.swift` to include read receipt indicator ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipt indicators display correctly for sent messages ✅ (via MessageStatusView)
- [x] Wire up read receipt state management in `ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift` ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipt state updates trigger UI changes ✅
- [x] Add loading/error/empty states for read receipts ✅
  - Test Gate: All states render correctly (read/unread/loading/error) ✅

---

## 5. Integration & Real-Time

Reference requirements from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- [x] Firebase service integration for read receipts ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipt updates sync to Firestore ✅
- [x] Real-time listeners for read receipt updates ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipts sync across devices <100ms ✅
- [x] Offline persistence for read receipts ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipts queue and sync on reconnect ✅
- [x] Integration with existing MessageService ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipts work seamlessly with message sending/receiving ✅

---

## 6. Tests

Follow patterns from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md` and `MessageAI/agents/test-template.md`.

- [x] Unit Tests (Swift Testing) ✅
  - Path: `MessageAITests/Services/ReadReceiptServiceTests.swift`
  - Test Gate: Service logic validated, edge cases covered ✅
  
- [x] UI Tests (XCUITest) ✅
  - Path: `MessageAIUITests/ReadReceiptUITests.swift`
  - Test Gate: User flows succeed, read receipts display correctly ✅
  
- [x] Service Tests (Swift Testing) ✅
  - Path: `MessageAITests/Services/ReadReceiptServiceTests.swift`
  - Test Gate: Firebase operations tested ✅
  
- [x] Multi-device sync test ✅
  - Test Gate: Use pattern from shared-standards.md for read receipt sync ✅
  
- [x] Visual states verification ✅
  - Test Gate: Read receipt states (read/unread/loading/error) render correctly ✅

---

## 7. Performance

Verify targets from `MessageAI/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- [x] Read receipt updates don't impact message scrolling performance ✅
  - Test Gate: Smooth 60fps scrolling maintained with read receipts ✅
- [x] Read receipt sync latency < 100ms ✅
  - Test Gate: Firebase read receipt updates measured ✅
- [x] Batch read receipt updates for performance ✅
  - Test Gate: Multiple read receipts batched efficiently ✅ (markChatAsRead uses batch)

---

## 8. Acceptance Gates

Check every gate from PRD Section 12:
- [x] All happy path gates pass (read receipts appear when messages viewed) ✅
- [x] All edge case gates pass (network failures, offline scenarios) ✅
- [x] All multi-user gates pass (real-time sync across devices) ✅
- [x] All performance gates pass (no impact on message performance) ✅

---

## 9. Documentation & PR

- [x] Add inline code comments for complex read receipt logic ✅
- [x] Update README if needed ✅
- [x] Create PR description (use format from MessageAI/agents/coder-agent-template.md) ✅
- [x] Verify with user before creating PR ✅
- [x] Open PR targeting develop branch ✅
- [x] Link PRD and TODO in PR description ✅

# PR-5 TODO â€” Performance & UX Optimization

**Branch**: `feat/pr-5-performance-ux-optimization`  
**Source PRD**: `MessageAI/docs/prds/pr-5-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Pete

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**: 
  - What's the optimal window size for message list windowing? (Start with 50 messages)
  - Should we implement custom scroll indicators for better performance? (Use native SwiftUI)
  - What's the best approach for optimistic UI state management? (Use @State with proper error handling)

- **Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed)**:
  - Performance targets are achievable with current Firebase setup
  - List windowing will significantly improve scrolling performance
  - Optimistic UI will enhance user experience without causing state issues
